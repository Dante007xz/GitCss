<h2>How to prepare</h2>
<p>1.-Mix the flour in a bowl together with the sugar, the baking powder or yeast and the salt. Next, reserve the mixture.</p>
<p>2.-In another bowl, mix the milk together with the oil or melted butter and the egg.</p>
<p>3.-You must add the mixture of flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in the bowl of milk with the egg. Mix but without overdoing it. It does not matter if there are small lumps, since they will disappear when cooked.</p>
<p>4.-You must lightly grease a small frying pan with oil. Next, clean the rest of the oil with kitchen paper and heat on the stove. When the pan is very hot, add a scoop of the pancake batter.</p>
<p>5.-Wait for small bubbles to appear on the surface of the dough. That's when you have to turn it around and let it brown slightly on the other side.</p>
<p>6.-As you cook the pancakes, leave them on a plate, stacking one on top of the other so that they stay warm.</p>
<p>7.-Finally, serve the fluffy pancakes with nuts, with chocolate chips, with honey, with some fruit syrup or with melted chocolate. You will see what a delicious breakfast! Tell us if you have prepared the recipe and better yet, send us a photo with the result.</p>
