<h2>How to prepare</h2>
<p>1.-Cook the bananas with their skins for about 20 minutes in plenty of water. If they are larger, they may need more time. Check that they are ready by piercing them with a fork in the middle, they must be soft.</p>
<p>2.-When taking them out of the water, remove the shell very carefully so as not to burn yourself. Leave them in a bowl to mash with a fork until they are pureed.</p>
<p>3.-Let the cinnamon soak in hot water and let it cool to add it to the mixture. Combine the rest of the ingredients in the banana puree and mix very well. To speed up the process, you can grate the panela and dissolve it with a splash of water.</p>
<p>4.-You should have a dough that you can take with your hands. To make the characteristic shape of the mandocas, take a ball of the mixture and roll it on a flat surface to make not very thin sticks, join their ends so that they are in the shape of a petal.</p>
<p>5.-Put them in a pot with enough oil to cover them and, when they are golden brown, you can take them out. Let the Venezuelan mandocas rest on a plate with absorbent paper and put a little grated cheese on top, they are ready to enjoy!.</p>
